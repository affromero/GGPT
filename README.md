Official PyTorch implementation of **Geometry-grounded Point Transformer (GGPT)** (CVPR 2026). GGPT is a method for high-quality 3D reconstruction from multiview images. For more details, please visit our [project webpage](https://chenyutongthu.github.io/research/ggpt).

## 🚀 Pretrained Models

You can download our pretrained checkpoint directly from Hugging Face: [YutongGoose/GGPT](https://huggingface.co/YutongGoose/GGPT).

```bash
# Recommended: download via huggingface-cli
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download YutongGoose/GGPT model.step228000.pth --local-dir ckpts/
```

## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/chenyutongthu/GGPT.git
cd GGPT
```


### 2. Install dependencies

#### 2.0 Create a virtual environment.
#### 2.1 Install torch, torchvision for your CUDA version. (The environment does not require specific CUDA or pytorch version. It has been tested in CUDA 12.1/12.3 and torch 2.2.0/2.5.1.)

#### 2.2 Install requirements for VGGT and SfM.
```
pip install -r requirements_sfm.txt
# Choose which matcher to use.
# For RoMav2
cd RoMAv2/ && pip install -e .
# For RoMav1
pip install fused-local-corr>=0.2.2
cd RoMA/ && pip install -e .
```

#### 2.3 \[Optional\] If you need to run GGPT, the 3D point transformer, please install the following packages in the same virtual environement.  You don't need to build another env for this.

```
pip install torch-sparse  # (add  `--no-build-isolation' if needed)
pip install torch-scatter # --no-build-isolation
pip install torch-geometric # --no-build-isolation
pip install torch-cluster # --no-build-isolation
cd Pointcept/ && pip install -e .
pip install spconv-cu121 # Ensure it matches your PyTorch CUDA version.
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation 
# Build flash-attn from source if needed. For example:
FLASH_ATTENTION_FORCE_BUILD=TRUE pip install --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir flash-attn
pip install gradio  # Required for the interactive demo app
pip install einops  # Required for model components
```
Note that the recipe of Ptv3 installation's highly depends on your pytorch and cuda version. You need to change the version of spconv and flash-attention accordingly, or install them from source when needed.

## 🎨 Interactive Demo

We provide an interactive Web UI powered by Gradio to run the pipeline sequentially (Feedforward -> SfM -> PT Refinement) and compare the 3D point clouds!

```bash
python demo_gradio.py
```
After starting the script, a local URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) will be generated. Open it in your browser to try it out!


## 📖 Usage & Examples

### 🚀 Running the Command-Line Demo

You can run the reconstruction pipeline directly from the command line using `run_demo.py`. This script will process a directory of images and generate the 3D point clouds.

```bash
# Run the demo on a custom image directory
python run_demo.py image_dir=/path/to/your/images
```

The outputs (including the feedforward points, SfM points, and the final GGPT points `ggpt_points.ply`) will be saved in the `outputs/demo/` directory by default.

### ⚙️ Configuration Settings (SfM)

You can adjust Structure-from-Motion (SfM) configuration blocks in the `.yaml` files (found under `configs/`) to better suit your data. 

```yaml
ba_config:
  shared_camera: True # Set it to False if images are captured with different camera intrinsics

dlt_config:
  # Adjust the filtering parameters if you need more accurate yet sparser SfM points. E.g.:
  score_thresh: 0.1       # Increase the matching confidence threshold to filter out noisy matchings
  cycle_err_thresh: 4     # Reduce the cycle error threshold to filter out noisy tracks
  max_epipolar_error: 4   # Reduce the epipolar error threshold to filter out noisy tracks
  min_tri_angle: 3        # Increase the triangulation angle threshold to filter out points with low parallax
  max_reproj_error: 4     # Reduce the reprojection error threshold to filter out noisy points
```
